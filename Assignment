High performance computing helps to reduce the time when performing tasks involves heavy computation. The following are several ways that modern technology has adopted when it comes to high performance computing.

1.	**Language :** Today, software language C, C++ and Fortran [1] are still among the most popular languages when it comes to building HPC computing.  Often it depends on the problem one is trying to solve. Fortran in general is much suited when it comes to numeric scientific computing whereas C++ may better suit for algorithms that can’t be expressed using arrays.

2.	**Cloud technology:** Complex workflow can often leverage today’s clound service get better performance. Cloud technology such as Microsoft Azure, Google cloud just to name a few, provides better storage space as well as CPU power compared to just a work laptop. Could computing also allow one to scale up or scale down more easily based on the Application’s need.
